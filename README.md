# AWS Lightsail

AWS Lightsail is a cloud computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that offers an easy and cost-effective way to launch and manage virtual private servers (VPS) or virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud. It simplifies the process of running a single virtual machine, making it accessible to users without extensive cloud computing expertise.
Key Features

AWS Lightsail offers a user-friendly and cost-effective solution for running a single virtual machine in the cloud. With its simplified setup, integrated services, and scalable resources, Lightsail enables users to quickly deploy and manage virtual machines without the need for advanced cloud computing knowledge.

# AWS EC2 for Multiple Virtual Machines

AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a highly scalable and flexible cloud computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It enables users to easily deploy and manage multiple virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud, allowing for efficient utilization of computing resources and providing greater flexibility for diverse workloads.

EC2 provides monitoring tools and metrics to track the performance of your instances. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor CPU utilization, network traffic, disk I/O, and other metrics. Additionally, you can leverage AWS Systems Manager to automate administrative tasks, streamline software installations, and simplify instance management.
Getting Started with EC2 for Multiple Virtual Machines

AWS EC2 provides a powerful and flexible platform for running multiple virtual machines in the cloud. With its scalability, diverse instance types, networking capabilities, storage options, and management tools, EC2 enables you to build and manage a resilient and efficient infrastructure to meet your specific workload requirements.
